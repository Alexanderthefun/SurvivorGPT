    const survivalTips = ["Prioritize shelter: In most situations, finding or building a shelter to protect you from the elements should be your top priority. Look for natural shelters like caves, or create a makeshift shelter using branches, leaves, and other available materials.",
"Stay hydrated: Finding a clean water source is crucial for survival. Collect rainwater, dew, or melt snow if a natural water source isn't available. Always purify water by boiling or using purification tablets before drinking to avoid illness.",
"Build a fire: A fire provides warmth, light, and a means to cook food. Learn how to build a fire using materials like dry leaves, twigs, and branches. Keep a firestarter or matches in a waterproof container as part of your survival kit.",
"Learn basic first aid: Knowing basic first aid techniques can be life-saving in emergency situations. Learn how to treat cuts, burns, fractures, and other common injuries. Carry a compact first aid kit with you when exploring the outdoors.",
"Know the rule of threes: Remember that you can generally survive three minutes without air, three hours in extreme weather without shelter, three days without water, and three weeks without food. Prioritize your needs accordingly.",
"Learn to navigate: Understanding how to navigate using a map, compass, or natural landmarks can help you find your way back to safety. Familiarize yourself with the area you're exploring and always carry a reliable navigation tool.",
"Signal for help: In case of an emergency, know how to signal for help. Use a whistle, signal mirror, or create a signal fire. In open areas, arrange rocks or branches in a visible SOS pattern.",
"Pack a survival kit: Carry a small, lightweight survival kit with essential items like a firestarter, knife, compass, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and a signaling device.",
"Stay calm and focused: Panic can lead to poor decision-making. In a survival situation, stay calm, assess your surroundings, and prioritize your needs before taking action.",
"Learn from the experts: Gain knowledge about survival techniques by reading books, attending courses, or watching videos from experienced survivalists. Practice these skills regularly to become proficient."]
